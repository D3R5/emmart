# Emmart ReactJs
This website is an ecommerce platform for various items using the FakeStore API (https://fakestoreapi.com). The home page features buttons at the top for Home, Products, About, Contact, as well as Login, Register, and Cart. It also displays an image, and below that, it showcases certain products with buttons to filter them by categories.

The product page displays all the available products and allows filtering by categories. When you click on a product, it takes you to its detailed page, where you can see the image, category, product name, rating, price, description, and buttons to add to cart or go to the cart.

The cart page shows an image of the product along with its name and price. You can increase the quantity of the selected product for purchase and proceed to checkout.
